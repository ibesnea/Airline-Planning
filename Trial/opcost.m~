%% This function determines the operational costs between airports i and j
% Input:
%     MaxR = maximum range of aircraft;
%     Cost_fixed = fixed operating cost per leg;
%     Cost_timed = time based cost in euro per hour;
%     Cost_fuel = fuel cost dependent on distance flown;
%     V = speed of aircraft;
%     d= distance between airport i and j;
% Variables
%     i= origin airport;
%     j= destination airport;
%     k=Number of aircraft types;
% Output
%     C= Total Cost;
%     Yield = Yield for flight from airport i to j;
